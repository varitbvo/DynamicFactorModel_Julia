For the most part, we're using FRED-MD's data series.  This document notes where we're not and some other stuff about arbitrary-ish assignment.  There are a little more than 40 series whose mnemonics in the original FRED-MD documentation don't match up with an actual FRED mnmonic, usually because they've spliced some variables (for example), or because the series are actually taken from somewhere outside FRED (this is the S&P series)
