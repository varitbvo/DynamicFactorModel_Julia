# Dynamic Factor Model 
## This is the first time I am using Github. This message shall be shown if I am successfully push the updated version of this Read Me file. 

The project is implemented in Julia. The important notion includes the following:
- Kalman Filter algorithm
- Principal Component Analysis
- Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm or Metropolis-Hasting algorithm
- Dynamic Factor Model

$$ Y = \mu + GX_t $$
$$ X_{t+1} = AX_{t} $$
